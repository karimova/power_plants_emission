## **About the Project**

Air pollution created by human activities (e.g. transportation and industrial production) or by natural events (e.g. wildfires) has been linked to severe environmental and public health consequences. Climate change, for example, has been at the center of national attention and left unchecked could have profound and irreversible effects on our planet.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of U.S. power plant emissions from 2016 through 2019.
I focus on three main pollutant gases emitted through the electricity production process: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>). I consider the relative production of these gases by U.S. power plants and associated environmental concerns.

## **Databases**
* Earthâ€™s changing surface temperature (1880-2015) - data from NASA <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">[1]</a>;
* U.S. electric powerplant data - US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/">[2]</a>;
* Amounts of fuel used, and quantity of energy generated (both monthly and annually) - EIA data <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/">[3]</a>;
* Geographical location of power plants (latitude and longitude) - EIA data <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860M/">[4]</a>;
* Fuel codes, emission data per fossil type of fuels - EIA data <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/emissions/">[5]</a> and United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data <a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks">[6]</a>

Pandas and Tableau were used for these analyses.
